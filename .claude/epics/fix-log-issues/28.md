# Task: Create comprehensive integration tests for logging system

## Description
Develop complete test suite covering all logging scenarios: startup failures, environment configurations, log rotation, and cross-environment compatibility. Ensure robust logging behavior in all deployment scenarios.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Test application startup with missing log directory permissions
- [ ] Verify graceful fallback when file logging fails
- [ ] Test all environment variable configurations
- [ ] Validate log rotation under high volume
- [ ] Test logging behavior in containerized environments

## Technical Details
- **Test scenarios**:
  - Filesystem permission failures
  - Environment variable combinations
  - Log rotation triggers and compression
  - Memory constraints and cleanup
- **Environments**: Local, containerized, production-like
- **Test data**: High-volume log generation for stress testing

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 26 must complete (provides complete logging implementation)

## Effort Estimate
- **Size**: M
- **Hours**: 8-10 hours
- **Parallel**: true (independent testing work)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Complete test coverage for all logging scenarios
- [ ] All edge cases and failure modes tested
- [ ] Cross-environment compatibility verified
- [ ] Automated test suite integrated with CI/CD
- [ ] Test documentation and runbooks created
