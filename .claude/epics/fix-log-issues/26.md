# Task: Implement structured logging standards

## Description
Establish and enforce structured logging standards with mandatory fields (timestamp, level, component, event) and optional contextual fields. Ensure all logs are machine-parseable JSON format.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Define mandatory log fields: timestamp, level, component, event, message
- [ ] Add support for optional contextual fields: user_id, request_id, correlation_id
- [ ] Ensure all logs output valid JSON format
- [ ] Update existing log statements to follow structured format
- [ ] Add log field validation and standards documentation

## Technical Details
- **Implementation**: Enhance centralized logging configuration
- **Required fields**: Every log must include timestamp, level, component, event
- **Optional fields**: Context-specific fields for tracing and debugging
- **Format enforcement**: Validation in logger factory to ensure compliance
- **Migration strategy**: Update high-priority log statements first, gradual rollout

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 25 must complete (provides standardized logger usage)

## Effort Estimate
- **Size**: M
- **Hours**: 6-8 hours
- **Parallel**: true (independent standardization work)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Structured logging standards defined and documented
- [ ] All logs output valid, parseable JSON
- [ ] Key log statements updated to follow standards
- [ ] Log aggregation tools can parse all output
- [ ] Standards enforcement built into logging system
