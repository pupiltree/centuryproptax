# Task: Implement structured logging standards

## Description
Establish and enforce structured logging standards with mandatory fields (timestamp, level, component, event) and optional contextual fields. Ensure all logs are machine-parseable JSON format.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Define mandatory log fields: timestamp, level, component, event, message
- [x] Add support for optional contextual fields: user_id, request_id, correlation_id
- [x] Ensure all logs output valid JSON format
- [x] Update existing log statements to follow structured format
- [x] Add log field validation and standards documentation

## Technical Details
- **Implementation**: Enhance centralized logging configuration
- **Required fields**: Every log must include timestamp, level, component, event
- **Optional fields**: Context-specific fields for tracing and debugging
- **Format enforcement**: Validation in logger factory to ensure compliance
- **Migration strategy**: Update high-priority log statements first, gradual rollout

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 25 must complete (provides standardized logger usage)

## Effort Estimate
- **Size**: M
- **Hours**: 6-8 hours
- **Parallel**: true (independent standardization work)

## Definition of Done
- [x] Structured logging standards defined and documented
- [x] All logs output valid, parseable JSON
- [x] Key log statements updated to follow standards
- [x] Log aggregation tools can parse all output
- [x] Standards enforcement built into logging system

## Implementation Summary
âœ… **COMPLETED**: Enhanced /src/core/logging.py with comprehensive structured logging:
- Added mandatory field validation (timestamp, level, component, event, message)
- Implemented optional contextual fields (user_id, request_id, correlation_id, etc.)
- All logs output valid JSON format with structured processors
- Created helper functions: create_structured_log_entry(), log_error_with_trace()
- Updated WhatsApp client and property tax assistant logging to structured format
- Added field validation with informational warnings for non-standard fields
- Maintains backward compatibility while encouraging structured format adoption
