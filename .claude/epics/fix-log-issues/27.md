# Task: Implement performance benchmarking for logging overhead

## Description
Create performance benchmarks to measure logging overhead and ensure it stays under 5ms per operation. Establish baseline metrics and monitoring for logging performance impact.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create performance test suite for logging operations
- [ ] Measure logging overhead in high-frequency scenarios
- [ ] Verify logging adds less than 5ms per API request
- [ ] Compare performance before/after logging improvements
- [ ] Establish monitoring for ongoing performance tracking

## Technical Details
- **Test framework**: Use existing test infrastructure
- **Benchmarks**:
  - Single log statement overhead
  - High-volume logging scenarios
  - API request logging impact
- **Metrics**: Response time, memory usage, CPU utilization
- **Monitoring**: Integration with existing performance monitoring

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 26 must complete (provides final logging implementation)

## Effort Estimate
- **Size**: S
- **Hours**: 4-5 hours
- **Parallel**: true (independent testing work)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Performance benchmarks created and running
- [ ] Logging overhead verified under 5ms threshold
- [ ] Baseline metrics established for ongoing monitoring
- [ ] Performance regression detection in place
- [ ] Documentation of performance characteristics
