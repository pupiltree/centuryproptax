# Task: Performance Monitoring Dashboard - Real-time metrics and system health visualization

## Description

Implement real-time performance monitoring dashboards showing response times, error rates, throughput, and system health metrics. This task will build upon the existing comprehensive logging system to create visual dashboards that provide immediate visibility into system performance and enable proactive issue detection and resolution.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Real-time performance dashboard with response time visualization
- [ ] Error rate monitoring with threshold alerting
- [ ] System throughput metrics and trend analysis
- [ ] API endpoint performance breakdown and comparison
- [ ] Database and Redis connection health monitoring
- [ ] Memory and CPU utilization tracking
- [ ] Request volume and pattern analysis
- [ ] Alert system for critical performance threshold breaches

## Technical Details

### Implementation Scope:
- **Metrics Collection**: Leverage existing logging system in `src/core/logging.py` for data collection
- **Visualization Framework**: Lightweight dashboard solution compatible with FastAPI infrastructure
- **Real-time Updates**: Live dashboard updates with minimal latency (<5 seconds)
- **Alert System**: Threshold-based alerting with escalation procedures

### Core Components:

1. **Performance Metrics Collection**
   - Response time tracking for all API endpoints
   - Error rate calculation and categorization
   - Request volume and concurrent user tracking
   - Database query performance monitoring

2. **Real-time Dashboard Framework**
   - Web-based dashboard accessible via FastAPI application
   - Live metrics visualization with auto-refresh
   - Interactive charts and graphs for trend analysis
   - Responsive design for mobile and desktop access

3. **System Health Monitoring**
   - CPU and memory utilization tracking
   - Database connection pool status
   - Redis connection health and performance
   - External API response time monitoring

4. **Alerting and Notification System**
   - Configurable threshold-based alerts
   - Multiple notification channels (email, Slack, webhook)
   - Alert escalation procedures for critical issues
   - Alert suppression and acknowledgment workflow

### Dashboard Architecture:
- **Base URL**: `/monitoring/performance/` for performance dashboard access
- **Metrics API**: RESTful endpoints for real-time metrics data
- **WebSocket Support**: Live updates for real-time dashboard functionality
- **Data Retention**: Configurable retention periods for historical analysis

### Integration Strategy:
- Build upon existing logging infrastructure in `src/core/logging.py`
- Use lightweight monitoring tools compatible with current FastAPI/Redis setup
- Leverage existing middleware patterns for metrics collection
- Integrate with current authentication and access control systems

## Implementation Steps

1. **Metrics Collection Enhancement**
   - Extend existing logging system to capture performance metrics
   - Implement middleware for automatic response time and error tracking
   - Add database and Redis performance monitoring
   - Create metrics aggregation and storage system

2. **Dashboard Framework Setup**
   - Select and configure lightweight dashboard framework
   - Create web-based dashboard interface
   - Implement real-time data visualization components
   - Set up responsive design for multiple device types

3. **Performance Visualization Implementation**
   - Create response time charts and histograms
   - Implement error rate tracking and visualization
   - Add throughput and request volume graphs
   - Develop API endpoint performance comparison views

4. **System Health Monitoring**
   - Implement CPU and memory utilization tracking
   - Add database connection pool monitoring
   - Create Redis health and performance metrics
   - Set up external API dependency monitoring

5. **Alerting System Configuration**
   - Configure threshold-based alert rules
   - Implement notification delivery system
   - Set up alert escalation procedures
   - Create alert management and acknowledgment interface

## Dependencies

**Prerequisites:**
- Existing comprehensive logging system (`src/core/logging.py`)
- Current FastAPI application structure for dashboard hosting
- Database and Redis infrastructure for metrics storage

**Integration Points:**
- Existing logging and middleware systems
- FastAPI application for dashboard serving
- Database for metrics storage and historical analysis
- Authentication system for dashboard access control

**Concurrent Development:**
- Can proceed in parallel with business analytics and infrastructure monitoring
- Coordinates with monitoring activation task for production deployment

## Effort Estimate

**Total Time:** 14-18 hours

**Breakdown:**
- Metrics collection enhancement: 3-4 hours
- Dashboard framework setup: 3-4 hours
- Performance visualization implementation: 4-5 hours
- System health monitoring: 2-3 hours
- Alerting system configuration: 2-3 hours

**Critical Path:** Can proceed independently but coordinates with other monitoring tasks for unified deployment.

## Success Criteria

**Quality Gates:**
- Real-time dashboard updates with <5 second latency
- Support for 1000+ metrics without performance degradation
- Alert system responds to threshold breaches within 30 seconds
- Dashboard accessible to 100+ concurrent users

**Deliverables:**
- Real-time performance monitoring dashboard
- Comprehensive metrics collection and aggregation system
- Threshold-based alerting with multiple notification channels
- System health monitoring for all critical infrastructure components
- Historical trend analysis and reporting capabilities

**Validation:**
- Dashboard accurately reflects live system performance
- Alerts trigger correctly for configured threshold breaches
