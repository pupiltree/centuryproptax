# Task: Monitoring System Activation - Production deployment of monitoring dashboards with alerting

## Description

Deploy comprehensive monitoring system to production with performance dashboards, business analytics, infrastructure monitoring, and alerting capabilities. This task activates all monitoring components in the production environment, ensures proper alerting configuration, and provides operational teams with the visibility needed for proactive system management and business optimization.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Production deployment of performance monitoring dashboards
- [ ] Business analytics dashboard activation with privacy compliance
- [ ] Infrastructure health monitoring integration with production systems
- [ ] Alert system configuration with escalation procedures
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard access controls and user management
- [ ] Data retention and archival policies implementation
- [ ] Monitoring system performance validation under production loads
- [ ] Operational team training and handover documentation
