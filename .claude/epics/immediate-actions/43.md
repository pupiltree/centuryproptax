# Task: Infrastructure Health Monitoring - Database, Redis, and external API health tracking

## Description

Establish comprehensive infrastructure health monitoring for database connections, Redis performance, external API dependencies, and system resource utilization. This task will create proactive monitoring capabilities that detect infrastructure issues before they impact users, providing operational teams with the visibility needed for reliable system operation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] PostgreSQL database connection monitoring and performance tracking
- [ ] Redis connection health and performance metrics
- [ ] External API dependency monitoring with response time tracking
- [ ] System resource utilization monitoring (CPU, memory, disk)
- [ ] Infrastructure health dashboard with real-time status indicators
- [ ] Proactive alerting for infrastructure threshold breaches
- [ ] Automated health check endpoints for load balancer integration
- [ ] Historical infrastructure performance trending and analysis

## Technical Details

### Implementation Scope:
- **Database Monitoring**: PostgreSQL connection pool, query performance, and resource utilization
- **Cache Monitoring**: Redis connection health, memory usage, and operation performance
- **Dependency Monitoring**: External API health checks and response time tracking
- **System Monitoring**: Server resource utilization and capacity planning metrics

### Core Components:

1. **Database Health Monitoring**
   - Connection pool status and utilization tracking
   - Query performance monitoring and slow query detection
   - Database resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk I/O)
   - Transaction and lock monitoring for performance optimization

2. **Redis Performance Monitoring**
   - Connection health and response time tracking
   - Memory usage and eviction policy monitoring
   - Operation performance (get, set, delete) metrics
   - Redis cluster health and replication status monitoring

3. **External API Dependency Monitoring**
   - Health check endpoints for all external API dependencies
   - Response time tracking and availability monitoring
   - Error rate analysis and failure pattern detection
   - Dependency impact assessment on system functionality

4. **System Resource Monitoring**
   - CPU utilization and load average tracking
   - Memory usage and allocation monitoring
   - Disk space and I/O performance tracking
   - Network utilization and connection monitoring

### Infrastructure Architecture:
- **Health Check Endpoints**: RESTful endpoints for infrastructure status queries
- **Monitoring Dashboard**: `/monitoring/infrastructure/` for infrastructure health visualization
- **Alert Integration**: Integration with existing alerting system for threshold breaches
- **Data Retention**: Historical data storage for trend analysis and capacity planning

### Integration Strategy:
- Leverage existing database and Redis connections for minimal overhead monitoring
- Build upon current logging infrastructure for centralized monitoring data
- Integrate with FastAPI application for health check endpoint exposure
- Use lightweight monitoring agents compatible with existing infrastructure

## Implementation Steps

1. **Database Monitoring Implementation**
   - Implement PostgreSQL connection pool monitoring
   - Add query performance tracking and slow query detection
   - Create database resource utilization metrics collection
   - Set up database health check endpoints and status reporting

2. **Redis Monitoring Setup**
   - Implement Redis connection health monitoring
   - Add memory usage and performance metrics collection
   - Create Redis operation performance tracking
   - Set up Redis cluster health and status monitoring

3. **External API Dependency Monitoring**
   - Create health check system for all external API dependencies
   - Implement response time and availability tracking
   - Add error rate monitoring and failure pattern detection
   - Create dependency impact assessment and reporting

4. **System Resource Monitoring**
   - Implement CPU, memory, and disk utilization tracking
   - Add network performance and connection monitoring
   - Create system capacity planning metrics and trending
   - Set up resource utilization alerting and notification

5. **Infrastructure Dashboard and Alerting**
   - Create comprehensive infrastructure health dashboard
   - Implement real-time status visualization and trending
   - Set up proactive alerting for infrastructure threshold breaches
   - Create automated health check endpoints for external monitoring

## Dependencies

**Prerequisites:**
- Existing PostgreSQL database infrastructure
- Current Redis cache implementation
- External API integrations requiring health monitoring
- System infrastructure access for resource monitoring

**Integration Points:**
- Database connection management for monitoring integration

- External API client libraries for health check implementation
- System monitoring agents for resource utilization tracking

**Concurrent Development:**
- Can proceed in parallel with performance and business analytics monitoring
- Coordinates with monitoring activation task for unified deployment

## Effort Estimate

**Total Time:** 12-16 hours

**Breakdown:**
- Database monitoring implementation: 3-4 hours
- Redis monitoring setup: 2-3 hours
- External API dependency monitoring: 3-4 hours
- System resource monitoring: 2-3 hours
- Dashboard and alerting integration: 2-3 hours

**Critical Path:** Can proceed independently but coordinates with other monitoring tasks for comprehensive system visibility.

## Success Criteria
