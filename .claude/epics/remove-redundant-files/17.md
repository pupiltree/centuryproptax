# Task: Configuration and Dependency Optimization

## Description

Optimize the application configuration and dependencies by removing environment variables for deleted services, updating package dependencies for removed functionality, and streamlining Docker configurations. This optimization ensures the property tax chatbot has minimal dependencies, clean configuration, and optimized deployment footprint.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Environment variables for deleted services completely removed
- [ ] Python requirements.txt updated to remove unused dependencies
- [ ] Node.js package.json cleaned of removed service dependencies
- [ ] Docker configurations optimized to exclude removed service containers
- [ ] Database migration files for removed features cleaned
- [ ] Configuration validation updated for remaining services only
- [ ] Deployment scripts optimized for simplified architecture
- [ ] Application startup time improved through dependency reduction

## Technical Details

### Environment Configuration Cleanup:
- **Removed Service Variables**: Voice API keys, image analysis credentials, Instagram tokens, medical service configurations
- **Database Connections**: Remove connection strings for deleted service databases
- **API Credentials**: Clean API keys and secrets for removed integrations
- **Webhook URLs**: Remove callback URLs and verification tokens for deleted services
- **Rate Limiting**: Clean rate limiting configurations for removed APIs

### Dependency Optimization Scope:
- **Python Dependencies**: Remove packages for voice processing, image analysis, Instagram API, medical integrations
- **Node.js Dependencies**: Clean frontend packages for removed features and integrations
- **System Dependencies**: Remove system packages and libraries for deleted services
- **Development Dependencies**: Clean testing and development packages for removed features

### Docker Configuration Optimization:
- **Service Containers**: Remove Docker containers for deleted services
- **Volume Mounts**: Clean volume configurations for removed service data
- **Network Configurations**: Optimize Docker networking for simplified architecture
- **Environment Files**: Clean Docker environment files and secrets

### Database Configuration Cleanup:
- **Migration Files**: Remove migration files for deleted service schemas
- **Connection Pools**: Optimize database connection pools for remaining services
- **Index Configurations**: Clean database indexes for removed features
- **Backup Configurations**: Update backup scripts to exclude deleted service data

### Safety Preservations:
- Maintain all property tax functionality configurations
- Preserve WhatsApp Business API environment variables and credentials
- Keep shared infrastructure configurations (logging, monitoring, security)
- Maintain core application environment variables

## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Variable Audit**
   - Identify all environment variables related to deleted services
   - Map environment variable dependencies across application modules
   - Create backup of current environment configuration

2. **Python Dependency Cleanup**
   - Analyze requirements.txt for packages related to removed services
   - Remove voice processing, image analysis, and medical service dependencies
   - Update version constraints for remaining packages
   - Test dependency resolution and compatibility

3. **Node.js Dependency Optimization**
   - Clean package.json of frontend dependencies for removed features
   - Remove development dependencies for deleted service testing
   - Update package-lock.json to reflect cleaned dependencies
   - Verify frontend build process after dependency removal

4. **Docker Configuration Optimization**
   - Remove Docker services for deleted functionality
   - Clean Docker Compose files to remove unused containers
   - Optimize Docker networking and volume configurations
   - Update Docker environment files and secrets

5. **Database Configuration Updates**
   - Remove migration files for deleted service schemas
   - Update database connection configurations
   - Clean database initialization scripts
   - Optimize database performance configurations

6. **Configuration Validation and Testing**
   - Validate application startup with optimized configurations
   - Test property tax chatbot functionality with cleaned dependencies
   - Verify WhatsApp integration with optimized environment
   - Measure performance improvements from dependency reduction

## Dependencies

**Prerequisites:**
- Tasks 002, 003, 004 must complete service removal (voice, image, Instagram)
- Task 005 must complete medical domain cleanup
- Clear identification of all dependencies related to removed services

**Sequential Execution:**
- Must run after all service removal tasks to avoid configuration conflicts
- Cannot run in parallel due to shared configuration file modifications
- Must complete before documentation updates (task 007)

**Critical Considerations:**
- Must preserve WhatsApp Business API configuration completely
- Avoid disruption to property tax tool configurations
- Maintain shared infrastructure settings (database, logging, monitoring)

## Effort Estimate

**Total Time:** 5-7 hours (Day 3 afternoon)

**Breakdown:**
- Environment variable audit and cleanup: 1-2 hours
- Python and Node.js dependency optimization: 2-3 hours
- Docker configuration optimization: 1-2 hours
- Database configuration updates: 1 hour
- Configuration validation and testing: 1 hour

**Risk Level:** Medium - Configuration changes can impact application startup

## Success Criteria

**Functional Validation:**
- Application starts successfully with optimized configuration
- Property tax chatbot functions correctly with cleaned dependencies
- WhatsApp integration operates normally with optimized environment
- All 6 property tax tools accessible and functional

**Technical Validation:**
- No unused environment variables remain in configuration files
- Python and Node.js dependencies contain only necessary packages
- Docker containers start successfully with optimized configurations
- Database connections work correctly with updated configurations

**Performance Validation:**
- Application startup time improved compared to pre-optimization
- Memory footprint reduced due to dependency cleanup
- Docker build time improved with optimized configurations
- No performance regression in property tax functionality

**Quality Gates:**
- Dependency security scan passes with cleaned packages
- Configuration validation tests pass completely
- No broken imports or missing dependencies
- Application deployment successful in clean environment

## Rollback Procedures

**Configuration Rollback:**
- Restore environment variables from backup before optimization
- Revert dependency files (requirements.txt, package.json) to previous versions
- Restore Docker configurations if container startup fails
- Rollback database configuration changes if connection issues occur

**Validation Steps:**
- Verify application startup after configuration rollback
- Confirm all services initialize correctly with restored configuration
- Test property tax functionality after dependency restoration
- Validate WhatsApp integration after environment rollback

**Emergency Procedures:**
- Immediate rollback if application fails to start
- Staged rollback to isolate configuration vs dependency issues
- Emergency deployment with previous configuration if production affected

## Special Considerations

**Configuration File Coordination:**
- Ensure no conflicts with other tasks modifying shared configuration files
- Coordinate environment variable changes with deployment team
- Maintain configuration consistency across development, staging, and production

**Dependency Security:**
- Perform security audit of remaining dependencies
- Update dependencies to latest secure versions where possible
- Remove dependencies with known vulnerabilities introduced by deleted services

**Performance Optimization:**
- Measure and document performance improvements from dependency reduction
- Optimize remaining dependency versions for performance
- Consider dependency consolidation opportunities

**Deployment Impact:**
- Update deployment scripts to reflect optimized configurations
- Modify CI/CD pipelines to use cleaned dependency lists
- Update environment setup documentation for simplified architecture
