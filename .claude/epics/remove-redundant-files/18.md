# Task: Documentation and Code Alignment

## Description

Update all documentation to accurately reflect the simplified property tax chatbot architecture after removing voice, image, Instagram, and medical functionality. This includes updating README files, API documentation, architecture diagrams, and deployment guides to match the implemented WhatsApp-only property tax functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] README files updated to remove references to deleted services
- [ ] API documentation cleaned to match implemented endpoints only
- [ ] Architecture diagrams updated to reflect simplified structure
- [ ] Deployment guides updated for optimized configuration
- [ ] User documentation focuses on property tax tools via WhatsApp
- [ ] Developer setup instructions simplified for reduced dependencies
- [ ] Configuration documentation matches optimized environment variables
- [ ] Testing documentation updated for simplified test suite

## Technical Details

### Documentation Files to Update:

- **Developer Setup**: Simplify setup instructions for reduced dependency requirements

### Content Cleanup Scope:
- **Service References**: Remove mentions of voice, image, Instagram, and medical services
- **API Endpoints**: Update API documentation to show only implemented endpoints
- **Configuration Examples**: Update configuration examples to match optimized environment
- **Feature Lists**: Update feature descriptions to focus on 6 property tax tools
- **Integration Guides**: Focus documentation on WhatsApp Business API integration only

### Architecture Documentation Updates:
- **System Diagrams**: Simplify architecture diagrams to show streamlined components
- **Data Flow**: Update data flow diagrams for WhatsApp → Property Tax processing
- **Component Diagrams**: Remove deleted service components, focus on active architecture
- **Deployment Architecture**: Update infrastructure diagrams for optimized deployment

### User-Facing Documentation:
- **Feature Documentation**: Focus on 6 property tax tools available via WhatsApp
- **User Guides**: Create WhatsApp-specific user interaction guides
- **FAQ Updates**: Update frequently asked questions for property tax domain
- **Troubleshooting**: Update troubleshooting guides for simplified architecture

### Safety Preservations:
- Maintain accurate documentation for all implemented property tax functionality
- Preserve detailed WhatsApp integration documentation
- Keep technical setup instructions comprehensive but simplified
- Maintain security and deployment best practices documentation

## Implementation Steps

1. **Documentation Audit**
   - Identify all documentation files that reference deleted services
   - Map documentation dependencies and cross-references
   - Create backup of current documentation state

2. **README and Main Documentation Updates**
   - Update main README to focus on property tax chatbot functionality
   - Remove multi-platform marketing language and feature claims
   - Simplify installation and setup instructions for reduced dependencies
   - Update project description and purpose statement

3. **API Documentation Cleanup**
   - Remove API endpoint documentation for deleted services
   - Update property tax API documentation to match current implementation
   - Clean request/response examples to show only active endpoints
   - Update authentication documentation for simplified integration

4. **Architecture Documentation Updates**
   - Simplify architecture diagrams to show WhatsApp → Property Tax flow
   - Remove service components for deleted functionality
   - Update deployment architecture for optimized configuration
   - Create new system overview for simplified structure

5. **User and Developer Documentation**
   - Update user guides to focus on WhatsApp property tax interactions
   - Simplify developer setup instructions for reduced dependencies
   - Update configuration documentation to match optimized environment
   - Clean testing documentation for simplified test suite

6. **Documentation Validation and Cross-Reference Check**
   - Verify all documentation links and references work correctly
   - Ensure documentation accuracy matches implemented functionality
   - Test developer setup instructions with cleaned dependencies
   - Validate user guides match actual WhatsApp chatbot behavior

## Dependencies

**Prerequisites:**
- Task 005 (Medical Domain Cleanup) must complete to remove medical references
- Task 006 (Configuration Optimization) must complete for accurate config documentation
- Clear understanding of final architecture after all service removals

**Sequential Execution:**
- Must run after configuration optimization to document accurate environment setup
- Cannot run in parallel due to need for complete picture of final architecture
- Must complete before final testing and validation (task 008)

**Critical Considerations:**
- Documentation must accurately reflect implemented functionality only
- Avoid creating documentation debt by documenting non-existent features
- Maintain comprehensive coverage of actual property tax capabilities

## Effort Estimate

**Total Time:** 4-6 hours (Day 4 morning)

**Breakdown:**
- Documentation audit and planning: 1 hour
- README and main documentation updates: 1-2 hours
- API documentation cleanup: 1-2 hours
- Architecture documentation updates: 1 hour
- User and developer documentation updates: 1 hour
- Documentation validation and cross-reference check: 1 hour

**Risk Level:** Low - Documentation updates with minimal functional impact

## Success Criteria

**Functional Validation:**
- Documentation accurately describes implemented property tax functionality
- Developer setup instructions work correctly with optimized dependencies
- User guides match actual WhatsApp chatbot behavior
- API documentation matches available endpoints

**Technical Validation:**
- All documentation links and cross-references work correctly
- Code examples in documentation execute successfully
- Configuration examples match optimized environment variables
- Architecture diagrams accurately represent simplified system

**Quality Validation:**
- Documentation completeness covers all implemented features
- No references to deleted services remain in any documentation
- User documentation provides clear guidance for property tax tools
- Developer documentation enables successful project setup

**Quality Gates:**
- Documentation review passes with stakeholder approval
- Developer can successfully set up project using updated documentation
- User can successfully interact with chatbot using updated guides
- No broken links or outdated references in documentation

## Rollback Procedures

**Documentation Rollback:**
- Restore documentation files from backup before updates
- Revert to previous documentation version if accuracy issues found
- Restore architecture diagrams if simplified versions cause confusion

**Validation Steps:**
- Verify restored documentation matches pre-update functionality
- Confirm developer setup instructions work with restored documentation
- Test user guides match actual system behavior after rollback

**Emergency Procedures:**
- Quick documentation patch if critical inaccuracies discovered
- Staged documentation updates if comprehensive changes cause issues
- Emergency user communication if documentation changes affect user experience

## Special Considerations

**Documentation Consistency:**
- Ensure consistent terminology throughout all documentation files
- Maintain unified voice and style across updated documentation
- Coordinate documentation changes with any ongoing development work

**User Experience Impact:**
- Consider user communication strategy for changed functionality
- Update any user-facing help or support documentation
- Ensure documentation changes don't confuse existing users

**SEO and Discoverability:**
- Update meta descriptions and titles to reflect property tax focus
- Remove SEO content for deleted features to avoid user confusion
- Optimize documentation for property tax related search terms

**Maintenance Strategy:**
- Establish documentation maintenance process for simplified architecture
- Create documentation templates for future property tax feature additions
- Set up automated checks to prevent documentation drift
