# Environment Configuration Audit - Issue #17

## Configuration Files Analysis

### Current State
- **Environment Files**: `.env` and `.env.example` present
- **Configuration**: `config/settings.py` exists
- **Dependencies**: `requirements.txt` present
- **Docker Files**: None found (good - already cleaned)
- **Package.json**: None found (project is Python-only)

## Environment Variables Audit

### 1. Current Environment Variables (.env)
✅ **PRESERVED (Required for Property Tax Service)**:
- WhatsApp Business API (WA_*): All preserved
- Gemini AI (GOOGLE_API_KEY, GEMINI_MODEL_*): All preserved
- Database (DATABASE_URL, REDIS_URL): All preserved
- Property Tax APIs (PROPERTY_TAX_*): All preserved
- Payment Integration (Razorpay/Mock): All preserved
- Security (SECRET_KEY, encryption): All preserved

❌ **ISSUES IDENTIFIED**:
- No environment variables found for removed services (GOOD)
- `.env` uses inconsistent variable names vs `.env.example` (need alignment)
- Some references in comments but no actual variables to remove

### 2. Environment Variable Name Inconsistencies
**Problem**: `.env` uses different variable names than `.env.example` and `settings.py`

`.env` has:
```
WA_PHONE_NUMBER_ID=668229953048351
WA_BUSINESS_ACCOUNT_ID=2150712978774203
WA_VERIFY_TOKEN=century_property_tax_whatsapp_webhook_secure_2024
WA_ACCESS_TOKEN=...
```

`.env.example` and `settings.py` expect:
```
WHATSAPP_TOKEN (not WA_ACCESS_TOKEN)
WHATSAPP_PHONE_ID (not WA_PHONE_NUMBER_ID)
VERIFY_TOKEN (not WA_VERIFY_TOKEN)
```

## Python Dependencies Audit

### Dependencies Analysis
✅ **CORE DEPENDENCIES** (Keep):
- FastAPI, Uvicorn, Pydantic: Core web framework
- LangGraph, LangChain: AI conversation flow
- Google Generative AI: Required for Gemini
- SQLAlchemy, Alembic, Redis: Database layer
- Razorpay: Payment integration
- Requests, AioHTTP: HTTP clients for APIs

❌ **POTENTIALLY REMOVABLE**:
- No obvious voice/image/medical dependencies found
- Comments reference future voice services (deepgram-sdk, whisper) but they're commented out

## Configuration Files Audit

### settings.py Issues
✅ **Good State**:
- No references to removed services
- Clean property tax focused configuration
- Legacy comments are minimal and documented

❌ **Inconsistencies**:
- Uses old variable names (WHATSAPP_TOKEN vs WA_ACCESS_TOKEN)
- Comments mention "not currently used" for some features

## Findings Summary

### What Needs Cleanup:
1. **Environment Variable Names**: Align `.env` with `.env.example` and `settings.py`
2. **Comments**: Remove "Future Phase" and "legacy" comments
3. **Unused Dependencies**: Verify all dependencies are actually used

### What's Already Clean:
1. **No Dead Services**: No environment variables for removed services
2. **No Docker Cruft**: No Docker files to clean
3. **Focused Dependencies**: Requirements.txt is already focused

### Critical Preservations Verified:
✅ Property tax functionality preserved
✅ WhatsApp integration preserved
✅ Database connections preserved
✅ Payment system preserved
