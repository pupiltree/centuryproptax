# Task: Property Data Generator - Realistic Texas Property Data Generation

## Description

Build a comprehensive property data generation service that creates realistic Texas property tax records for demonstration and testing purposes. This service will generate diverse property scenarios including residential, commercial, and industrial properties with accurate Texas-specific tax data, geographic distributions, and demographic patterns to support convincing demo presentations and thorough development testing.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Property data generator service (`services/mock_data/property_tax_generator.py`) implemented
- [ ] Realistic Texas property records with accurate geographic distribution
- [ ] Support for residential, commercial, and industrial property types
- [ ] Varied tax scenarios: current, delinquent, exemptions, appeals, improvements
- [ ] Texas-specific tax rates and assessment methodologies
- [ ] Property value distributions matching Texas market data
- [ ] Homestead exemptions and agricultural exemptions properly modeled
- [ ] Property history generation (sales, improvements, reassessments)
- [ ] Configurable data scenarios for different demo needs
- [ ] Performance optimized for <100ms generation times
- [ ] Data consistency validation and relationship integrity
- [ ] Integration with existing FastAPI app data models

## Technical Details

### Core Generation Features:
- **Property Types**: Single-family residential, condos, townhomes, commercial retail, office buildings, industrial warehouses, vacant land, agricultural
- **Geographic Distribution**: Harris, Dallas, Travis, Tarrant, Bexar, and other major Texas counties with realistic ZIP code coverage
- **Value Ranges**: Market-accurate property values by county and property type ($50K-$50M range)
- **Tax Scenarios**: Current payments, delinquent accounts, exemption holders, appeal cases, new construction, improvements
- **Assessment Data**: Land value, improvement value, total assessed value, market value, capped value
- **Owner Information**: Realistic names, addresses, ownership types (individual, LLC, trust, corporation)

### Data Accuracy Requirements:
- **Tax Rates**: Current Texas county and municipal tax rates (0.8% - 3.2% range)
- **Exemptions**: Homestead ($40K max), Senior ($10K), Disabled Veterans ($12K), Agricultural, Historic
- **Assessment Ratios**: Commercial 100%, Residential varies by jurisdiction
- **Payment History**: Monthly payment schedules, penalty calculations, interest accrual
- **Property Characteristics**: Square footage, lot size, year built, bedroom/bathroom counts, construction materials

### Generation Parameters:
- **County Selection**: Generate properties across major Texas counties with population-weighted distribution
- **Scenario Mix**: 70% current accounts, 15% delinquent, 10% exemption holders, 5% appeal cases
- **Property Age Distribution**: Realistic distribution from 1950s to 2024 construction
- **Value Appreciation**: Historical value changes based on Texas market trends
- **Owner Demographics**: Age, income, and ownership duration distributions

## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Foundation Setup**
   - Research and compile Texas county tax rates and assessment methodologies
   - Create realistic property value distributions by county and property type
   - Define property characteristic ranges and relationships
   - Set up demographic and geographic data structures

2. **Core Generator Engine**
   - Implement property record generation with configurable parameters
   - Create property value calculation algorithms using Texas methodologies
   - Build owner information generation with realistic demographic patterns
   - Implement property history generation (sales, improvements, reassessments)

3. **Tax Scenario Generation**
   - Create current account payment schedules and history
   - Generate delinquent account scenarios with penalties and interest
   - Implement exemption calculations for various Texas exemption types
   - Build appeal case scenarios with dispute history and resolutions

4. **Geographic and Market Accuracy**
   - Implement county-specific tax rates and assessment practices
   - Create ZIP code distribution matching Texas population patterns
   - Generate property values consistent with local market conditions
   - Ensure school district and municipal tax integration

5. **Performance and Validation**
   - Optimize generation algorithms for <100ms response times
   - Implement data validation to ensure realistic relationships
   - Create caching mechanisms for frequently requested scenarios
   - Build data consistency checks and integrity validation

## Dependencies

**Prerequisites:**
- Tasks 31-33 provide FastAPI infrastructure and data models
- Texas tax rate and assessment methodology research
- County demographic and geographic data collection
- Property market value research for major Texas markets

**External Data Sources:**
- Texas Comptroller county tax rate data
- Census demographic data for Texas counties
- Real estate market data for property value distributions
- Texas homestead and exemption law requirements

**Integration Requirements:**
- Existing FastAPI app data models and database schemas
- Configuration management system for scenario parameters
- Caching infrastructure for performance optimization
- Error handling and logging integration

## Effort Estimate

**Total Time:** 20-25 hours (Week 2, Days 1-3)

**Breakdown:**
- Research and data foundation: 5-6 hours
- Core generator engine development: 8-10 hours
- Tax scenario and exemption logic: 4-5 hours
- Geographic accuracy and market integration: 3-4 hours
- Performance optimization and validation: 2-3 hours
- Testing and integration: 2-3 hours

**Risk Level:** Medium - Requires accurate Texas tax law implementation and realistic data patterns

## Success Criteria

**Functional Validation:**
- Generate realistic property records for all major Texas counties
- Support all common property tax scenarios encountered in Texas
- Property values and tax calculations match Texas methodologies
- Generated data passes logical consistency checks

**Performance Validation:**
- Property generation completes in <100ms for individual records
- Bulk generation supports 1000+ records in <5 seconds
- Memory usage remains under 100MB for active dataset
- Generated data caching provides consistent responses

**Quality Gates:**
- Property values fall within realistic ranges for each county
- Tax calculations match Texas assessment methodologies
- Exemption scenarios reflect actual Texas exemption law
- Generated demographics match Texas county population patterns

**Demo Readiness:**
- Property records suitable for sales presentations
- Diverse scenarios demonstrate system capabilities
- Data appears authentic to Texas property tax professionals
- Consistent narrative across related property records

## Rollback Procedures

**Development Rollback:**
- Revert to simple mock data generation if complex scenarios fail
- Fall back to single-county generation if multi-county complexity issues arise
- Simplify property types if comprehensive coverage proves problematic

**Performance Rollback:**
- Implement pre-generated data cache if real-time generation too slow
- Reduce property history depth if memory usage excessive
- Simplify calculations if accuracy requirements conflict with performance

**Data Quality Rollback:**
- Use simplified property characteristics if realistic generation too complex
- Fall back to basic tax scenarios if comprehensive scenario generation fails
- Implement manual data curation if automated generation produces unrealistic results

## Special Considerations

**Legal and Compliance:**
- Ensure generated data doesn't inadvertently match real property records
- Use fictitious but realistic names and addresses to avoid privacy issues
- Implement data anonymization to prevent accidental real data exposure

**Texas-Specific Requirements:**
- Accurate implementation of Texas Property Tax Code requirements
- Proper handling of various Texas exemption types and calculations
- Realistic modeling of Texas assessment cap and protest procedures
- Integration with Texas county-specific tax rate variations

**Scalability Planning:**
- Design for future expansion to additional states if needed
- Implement modular architecture for different tax jurisdictions
- Plan for integration with real government APIs when authorization obtained
- Support for custom scenario configuration by sales and demo teams

**Data Relationships:**
- Ensure generated property histories maintain logical consistency
- Implement realistic property improvement and reassessment patterns
- Generate family relationships for properties with shared ownership
- Maintain realistic timing relationships between events (sales, improvements, appeals)
