# Task: Integration & Testing - Replace Government API Calls with Mock Endpoints

## Description

Replace all existing government API calls in the application with mock endpoints, ensuring seamless integration without breaking existing functionality. Implement comprehensive testing to validate that all property tax workflows continue to work correctly with mock data. This task ensures the application operates independently of external government APIs while maintaining full demo and development capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All government API calls replaced with mock endpoint calls
- [ ] Existing property tax workflows function without modification
- [ ] Mock endpoints integrated into FastAPI application structure
- [ ] Environment-based API switching fully functional
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite covers all mock integrations
- [ ] Response times under 200ms for all mock endpoints
- [ ] Error handling maintains consistency with government API behavior
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing application interfaces

## Technical Details

### API Replacement Strategy:
- **Configuration-Based Switching**: Use `PROPERTY_TAX_API_MODE` environment variable
- **Seamless Integration**: Mock endpoints return identical response structures
- **Fallback Handling**: Graceful degradation when switching between modes
- **Response Consistency**: Mock responses match government API formats exactly
- **Performance Optimization**: Mock responses cached for consistent behavior

### Integration Points:
- **WhatsApp Bot Integration**: Property tax queries continue working through WhatsApp
- **Web Interface**: Property tax tools work seamlessly in web interface
- **API Endpoints**: Internal API calls redirect to mock endpoints transparently
- **Database Operations**: Mock data integrates with existing database models
- **Authentication**: Mock endpoints respect existing authentication patterns

### Mock Endpoint Coverage:
- **Property Calculator**: `/api/mock/property/calculator` replaces Texas Comptroller calculator
- **Property Records**: `/api/mock/property/records` replaces government record lookups
- **Tax Notifications**: `/api/mock/property/notifications` replaces official notifications
- **Payment History**: `/api/mock/property/payments` replaces government payment systems
- **Assessment Data**: `/api/mock/property/assessments` replaces county assessment APIs

### Testing Strategy:
- **Unit Tests**: Test each mock endpoint individually for correct responses
- **Integration Tests**: Validate mock endpoints work with existing application layers
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete property tax workflows using mock data
- **Performance Tests**: Ensure mock endpoints meet response time requirements
- **Compatibility Tests**: Verify existing code works without modification

## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Configuration Setup**

3. **Mock Endpoint Integration**
   - Register mock endpoints with existing FastAPI application

   - Test error handling and user experience with mock endpoints

6. **Web Interface Integration**
   - Test property tax web tools with mock data integration

   - Validate caching behavior for frequently requested mock data
   - Ensure memory usage remains acceptable with mock data storage

8. **Documentation and Setup Guides**
   - Update developer setup documentation for mock API usage
   - Create troubleshooting guide for API mode switching
   - Document mock data scenarios and their use cases
   - Provide configuration examples for different deployment environments

## Dependencies

**Prerequisites:**
- Task 31 (Mock API Infrastructure) must be complete for endpoint availability

- Authentication and authorization systems must work with mock endpoints

**Testing Dependencies:**
- Test data must be available from Property Data Generator
