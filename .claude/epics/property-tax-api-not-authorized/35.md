- [ ] Proration calculations for partial year assessments
- [ ] Appeal and protest value adjustment handling
- [ ] Multi-jurisdiction tax calculations (county, city, school district, MUD)
- [ ] Tax year rollover and assessment cap calculations
- [ ] Performance optimized for <50ms calculation times
- [ ] Comprehensive unit test coverage for all calculation scenarios

## Technical Details

### Core Calculation Components:
- **Assessment Calculations**: Market value to assessed value conversion using Texas ratios
- **Exemption Processing**: Homestead, senior, disabled veteran, agricultural, historic exemptions
- **Tax Rate Application**: County, municipal, school district, and special district rates
- **Proration Logic**: Mid-year sales, new construction, improvement completion
- **Delinquency Calculations**: Penalty rates, interest accrual, collection costs
- **Payment Allocation**: FIFO principal payment with penalty/interest distribution
- **Cap Calculations**: 10% assessment increase limits for homestead properties

### Texas-Specific Requirements:
- **Homestead Exemptions**: $40K maximum general, additional school exemptions
- **Assessment Ratios**: 100% market value for most properties, special ratios for agricultural
- **Penalty Structure**: 7% first month, 1% each additional month, 12% annual interest
- **School Tax Compression**: M&O rate compression and supplemental payments
- **Agricultural Valuation**: Productivity value vs market value calculations
- **Disabled Veteran Exemptions**: $12K maximum, percentage-based on disability rating

### Calculation Precision:
- **Monetary Values**: Precise to penny calculations with proper rounding
- **Tax Rates**: Support millage rates to 6 decimal places
- **Exemption Amounts**: Exact Texas statutory amounts and percentage calculations
- **Interest Calculations**: Daily interest accrual with proper compounding
- **Proration Accuracy**: Exact day calculations for partial year assessments

## Implementation Steps

1. **Assessment Calculation Engine**
   - Implement market value to assessed value conversion
   - Build exemption calculation algorithms for all Texas exemption types
   - Create taxable value calculation with exemption deductions
   - Implement assessment cap calculations for homestead properties

2. **Tax Rate Processing**
   - Build multi-jurisdiction tax rate application
   - Implement school district compression calculations
   - Create special district tax processing (MUD, PID, etc.)
   - Handle tax rate adoption and effective rate calculations

3. **Delinquency and Penalty Logic**
   - Implement penalty calculation algorithms (7% + 1% monthly)
   - Build interest accrual calculations (12% annually, daily compounding)
   - Create collection cost calculations and attorney fees
   - Implement payment allocation algorithms (FIFO principal payment)

4. **Proration and Timing Calculations**
   - Build mid-year sale proration calculations
   - Implement new construction and improvement proration
   - Create supplement and correction calculation handling
   - Handle tax year rollover and prior year adjustments

5. **Validation and Performance**
   - Implement calculation result validation and consistency checks
   - Optimize algorithms for <50ms response times
   - Build comprehensive unit test coverage for all scenarios
   - Create calculation audit trails for debugging and validation

## Dependencies

**Prerequisites:**
- Task 34 (Property Data Generator) provides realistic property records
- Tasks 31-33 provide API infrastructure and data models
- Texas Property Tax Code research and implementation requirements
- County-specific tax rate data collection and integration

**Calculation Data Requirements:**
- Current Texas county and municipal tax rates
- School district tax rates and compression factors
- Special district rates (MUD, PID, hospital districts)
- Exemption amounts and percentage calculations
- Penalty and interest rate schedules

**Integration Dependencies:**
- Property data models from Task 34 generator
- API endpoint structure from Tasks 31-33
- Configuration management for tax rates and exemption amounts
- Error handling and logging systems

## Effort Estimate

**Total Time:** 18-22 hours (Week 2, Days 3-5)

**Breakdown:**
- Assessment and exemption calculations: 6-8 hours
- Tax rate and multi-jurisdiction processing: 4-5 hours
- Delinquency and penalty algorithms: 4-5 hours
- Proration and timing calculations: 2-3 hours
- Performance optimization and validation: 2-3 hours
- Comprehensive testing and integration: 3-4 hours

**Risk Level:** High - Requires precise implementation of complex Texas tax law

## Success Criteria

**Calculation Accuracy:**
- Tax calculations match Texas Comptroller methodologies
- Exemption calculations reflect current Texas law requirements
- Penalty and interest calculations match statutory rates
- Proration calculations provide accurate partial year assessments

**Performance Validation:**
- Individual property calculations complete in <50ms
- Bulk calculations support 100+ properties in <2 seconds
- Complex multi-jurisdiction calculations maintain performance standards
- Memory usage remains efficient for large calculation batches

**Legal Compliance:**
- All calculations reflect current Texas Property Tax Code requirements
- Exemption processing matches Texas statutory requirements
- Penalty and interest calculations follow Texas collection procedures
- Assessment methodologies align with Texas Comptroller guidelines

**Quality Gates:**
- 100% unit test coverage for all calculation scenarios
- Calculation results validated against known Texas examples
- Edge cases handled properly (zero assessments, maximum exemptions)
- Calculation audit trails provide clear reasoning for all results

## Rollback Procedures

**Calculation Rollback:**
- Simplify calculations to basic tax rate application if complex scenarios fail
- Fall back to single-jurisdiction calculations if multi-jurisdiction proves problematic
- Implement simplified exemption calculations if full Texas law too complex

**Performance Rollback:**
- Pre-calculate common scenarios if real-time calculation too slow
- Implement calculation result caching for frequently requested scenarios
- Simplify precision requirements if performance targets not achievable
