## Description
Replace unrealistic immediate service promises with accurate 6-12 month property tax protest timelines. This sets proper expectations about the ARB hearing process, seasonal deadlines, and overall protest duration to align with Texas property tax law requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] May 15 protest filing deadline communicated clearly
- [ ] 6-12 month overall process timeline explained
- [ ] ARB hearing scheduling (August-October) mentioned
- [ ] Evidence gathering period expectations set
