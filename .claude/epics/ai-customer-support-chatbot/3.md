# Task: Database Schema Adaptation - Adapt models for property tax entities

## Description

Adapt the Krishna Diagnostics database schema to support property tax entities and workflows. This involves modifying existing models and creating new ones to handle property records, tax assessments, appeals, and customer inquiries specific to property tax administration.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Database models updated for property tax domain entities
- [ ] Property records, assessments, and appeals models created
- [ ] Customer/property owner relationship models established
- [ ] Chat history and AI interaction models adapted for property tax context
- [ ] Database migrations created and tested
- [ ] All foreign key relationships properly established
- [ ] Indexes optimized for property tax query patterns

## Technical Details

### Core Entity Models to Create/Adapt:

#### Property Tax Entities:
- **Property**: Address, parcel ID, property type, square footage, etc.
- **PropertyOwner**: Name, contact info, relationship to property
- **TaxAssessment**: Year, assessed value, tax amount, due dates
- **Appeal**: Status, submission date, reason, documents, outcomes
- **Payment**: Amount, date, method, reference numbers

#### Customer Support Entities:
- **Customer**: Adapted from Krishna's patient model for property owners
- **ChatSession**: Property tax-specific conversation context
- **Inquiry**: Categorized property tax questions and resolutions
- **SupportTicket**: Formal support requests with property tax classifications

### Schema Modifications:
- Update user roles for property tax staff (assessor, clerk, appeals officer)
- Modify chat context to include property and assessment information
- Add property tax-specific categorization for inquiries
- Create lookup tables for property types, tax rates, and appeal reasons

### Migration Strategy:
- Create new migrations for property tax entities
- Preserve existing chat and AI functionality structures
- Add seed data for property tax categories and types
- Update foreign key relationships appropriately

## Dependencies

- Task 2 (Codebase Adaptation) must be completed
- Database access and configuration
- Understanding of property tax business logic and relationships

## Effort Estimate

**2-3 days**

- Day 1: Design new schema and modify existing models
- Day 2: Create migrations and update relationships
- Day 3: Test migrations, seed data, and validate relationships

## Definition of Done

- All property tax entity models created and properly related
- Database migrations run successfully
- Foreign key relationships established and tested
- Seed data for property tax categories and types loaded
- Chat and AI functionality models adapted for property tax context
- Schema documented and ready for application integration
- No breaking changes to core AI customer support functionality
