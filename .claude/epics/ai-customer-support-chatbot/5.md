# Task: Property Tax Tools Development - Develop 6 domain-specific tools with mock data

## Description

Develop six specialized property tax tools that will serve as the foundation for AI-powered customer support. These tools will replace Krishna Diagnostics' medical tools and provide property tax-specific functionality with mock data for initial development and testing.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Property Validation Tool implemented with property record lookup
- [ ] Savings Calculator Tool developed for tax savings estimates
- [ ] Deadline Tracking Tool created for tax payment and appeal deadlines
- [ ] Lead Qualification Tool built for customer qualification scoring
- [ ] Document Processing Tool implemented for tax document analysis
- [ ] Consultation Scheduling Tool developed for appointment management
- [ ] All tools include comprehensive mock data for testing
- [ ] Tools integrate with existing AI chat framework
- [ ] Unit tests created for each tool with verbose output
- [ ] Tools follow consistent API interface patterns

## Technical Details

### Core Tools to Develop:

#### 1. Property Validation Tool
- Validates property addresses and parcel IDs
- Returns property details (type, size, assessment history)
- Mock data: 100+ realistic Texas properties
- Validates against common address formats and parcel ID patterns

#### 2. Savings Calculator Tool
- Calculates potential tax savings from appeals or exemptions
- Considers homestead exemptions, senior exemptions, disability exemptions
- Mock data: Current tax rates for major Texas counties
- Provides before/after scenarios with estimated savings

#### 3. Deadline Tracking Tool
- Tracks tax payment deadlines by county
- Monitors appeal filing deadlines
- Sends notifications for upcoming deadlines
- Mock data: 2024-2025 tax calendar for major Texas counties

#### 4. Lead Qualification Tool
- Scores potential customers based on property value and appeal likelihood
- Considers assessment increase percentage and property characteristics
- Mock data: Assessment patterns and appeal success rates
- Returns qualification score and recommended actions

#### 5. Document Processing Tool
- Processes tax statements, appraisal notices, and appeal documents
- Extracts key information (property details, assessed values, deadlines)
- Mock data: Sample document templates and OCR responses
- Handles PDF uploads and text extraction

#### 6. Consultation Scheduling Tool
- Manages appointment scheduling for property tax consultations
- Integrates with calendar systems and availability
- Mock data: Consultant schedules and time slots
- Handles time zone conversions for Texas regions

### Implementation Requirements:

- Follow Krishna Diagnostics tool architecture patterns
- Implement consistent error handling and validation
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Include comprehensive logging for debugging
- Create mock data that reflects real Texas property tax scenarios
- Ensure tools can be easily swapped with real data connections later

### Mock Data Standards:
- Use realistic Texas county names and property types
- Include diverse property values ($50K to $2M range)
- Represent various exemption scenarios
- Include edge cases for testing (missing data, invalid formats)
- Generate data that supports meaningful testing scenarios

## Dependencies

- Task 3 (Database Schema Adaptation) must be completed
- Understanding of Krishna Diagnostics tool architecture
- Knowledge of Texas property tax processes and data formats

## Effort Estimate

**2-3 days**

- Day 1: Implement Property Validation and Savings Calculator tools
- Day 2: Develop Deadline Tracking and Lead Qualification tools
- Day 3: Create Document Processing and Consultation Scheduling tools, plus testing

## Definition of Done

- All 6 property tax tools implemented and tested
- Mock data comprehensive enough for realistic testing scenarios
- Tools integrate seamlessly with AI chat framework
- Unit tests pass with verbose debugging output
- Tools follow consistent patterns and can be easily extended
- Documentation includes tool capabilities and mock data structures
- No conflicts with existing Krishna Diagnostics core functionality
