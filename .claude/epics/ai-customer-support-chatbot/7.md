# Task: Knowledge Base and RAG System - Create RAG system with real Texas property tax law data

## Description

Create a comprehensive RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system populated with real Texas property tax law data from comptroller.texas.gov and other authoritative sources. This will provide the AI customer support system with accurate, up-to-date information for property tax guidance and replace any medical knowledge base components from Krishna Diagnostics.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] RAG system architecture implemented and integrated
- [ ] Texas property tax law data scraped from comptroller.texas.gov
- [ ] Document processing pipeline created for legal text
- [ ] Vector embeddings generated for property tax documents
- [ ] Search and retrieval functionality optimized for property tax queries
- [ ] Knowledge base covers all major property tax topics
- [ ] Real-time updates mechanism for changing tax laws
- [ ] Citation tracking for legal references and sources
- [ ] Performance optimized for quick response times
- [ ] Quality control measures for data accuracy

## Technical Details

### Core RAG System Components:

#### 1. Data Source Integration
- **Primary Source**: comptroller.texas.gov property tax sections
- **Secondary Sources**: County appraisal district websites, Texas statutes
- **Document Types**: Tax codes, regulations, procedures, forms, FAQs
- **Update Frequency**: Monthly scraping for law changes and updates
- **Format Handling**: PDF, HTML, structured data extraction

#### 2. Document Processing Pipeline
- Web scraping tools for government websites
- PDF text extraction and cleaning
- Legal document parsing and structuring
- Metadata extraction (effective dates, authority, jurisdiction)
- Content deduplication and quality filtering

#### 3. Vector Database and Embeddings
- Implement using existing Krishna Diagnostics vector infrastructure
- Generate embeddings optimized for property tax terminology
- Chunk documents for optimal retrieval granularity
- Index by topic categories (exemptions, appeals, assessments, etc.)
- Support semantic search across legal concepts

#### 4. Retrieval and Search Optimization
- Semantic search for property tax concepts and terms
- Keyword matching for specific statutes and regulations
- Context-aware retrieval based on conversation history
- Relevance scoring and ranking algorithms
- Multi-modal search (text queries, document references)

### Knowledge Base Content Areas:

#### Legal Framework
- Texas Property Tax Code (Title 1, Subtitle E)
- Constitutional provisions related to property taxation
- Administrative rules and procedures
- Court decisions and precedents
- County-specific ordinances and procedures

#### Practical Guidance
- Property assessment procedures and timelines
- Exemption applications and qualification criteria
- Appeal processes and required documentation
- Payment options and installment plans
- Protest hearing procedures and evidence requirements

#### Forms and Documentation
- Official state and county forms
- Required documentation for various procedures
- Sample letters and filing templates
- Deadline calendars and important dates
- Fee schedules and payment information

### Technical Implementation:

#### Data Acquisition Strategy
- Automated web scraping with respectful rate limiting
- API integration where available (county systems)
- Manual curation for complex legal documents
- Regular monitoring for website changes and updates
- Backup sources for critical information

#### Quality Assurance
- Legal accuracy verification processes
- Source citation and reference tracking
- Version control for document updates
- Conflict detection between sources
- Expert review workflows for complex topics

#### Performance Requirements
- Sub-200ms response times for common queries
- Accurate retrieval for 95% of property tax questions
- Comprehensive coverage of Texas property tax law
- Real-time updates for time-sensitive information
- Scalable architecture for growing document corpus

## Dependencies

- Task 2 (Codebase Adaptation) must be completed
- Access to web scraping infrastructure
- Vector database and embedding services
- Legal expertise for content validation
- Understanding of Texas property tax law structure

## Effort Estimate

**3-4 days**

- Day 1: Set up RAG infrastructure and data acquisition pipeline
- Day 2: Scrape and process comptroller.texas.gov data
- Day 3: Generate embeddings and optimize retrieval system
- Day 4: Test system performance and implement quality controls

## Definition of Done

- RAG system successfully integrated with AI chat framework
- Comprehensive Texas property tax knowledge base populated
- Search and retrieval performance meets response time requirements
- Data accuracy verified through spot-checking and expert review
- Automated update mechanism operational for law changes
- Citation tracking functional for all retrieved information
- System handles edge cases and provides appropriate fallbacks
- Documentation complete for knowledge base maintenance and updates
- No dependencies on Krishna Diagnostics medical knowledge components
