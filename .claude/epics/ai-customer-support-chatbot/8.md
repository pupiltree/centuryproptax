# Task 8: Demo Environment and Mock Data Setup

## Overview
Create a comprehensive demo environment with realistic mock data scenarios and test conversations to showcase the AI customer support chatbot capabilities for stakeholder demonstrations and user acceptance testing.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Demo environment configured with realistic property tax scenarios
- [ ] Mock customer data representing diverse use cases and demographics
- [ ] Pre-scripted conversation flows covering common support scenarios
- [ ] Edge case scenarios for testing system boundaries
- [ ] Demo-ready interface with clean, professional presentation
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established for demo scenarios
- [ ] Documentation for demo script and talking points

## Technical Requirements

### Mock Data Creation
- Create realistic property owner profiles with varied scenarios:
  - First-time property owners with basic questions
  - Experienced owners with complex multi-property situations
  - Senior citizens requiring extra assistance
  - Business owners with commercial property inquiries
- Generate sample property records with diverse characteristics:
  - Residential, commercial, and mixed-use properties
  - Various assessment values and tax scenarios
  - Historical payment records and exemption applications
- Create representative inquiry types and response patterns

### Demo Scenarios
- **Basic Information Requests**: Property values, tax rates, payment due dates
- **Payment Processing**: Payment methods, installment plans, late fees
- **Assessment Appeals**: Process explanation, deadline reminders, form assistance
- **Exemption Applications**: Eligibility criteria, application guidance, status updates
- **Complex Multi-Property**: Portfolio management, consolidated billing inquiries
- **Escalation Scenarios**: When to transfer to human agents

### Test Conversations
- Develop scripted conversation flows for consistent demonstrations
- Include natural language variations to show AI flexibility
- Create scenarios that highlight key differentiating features
- Test multilingual capabilities with Spanish language scenarios
- Prepare fallback scenarios for demonstration contingencies

## Implementation Details

### Environment Setup
- Configure isolated demo database with mock data
- Set up demo-specific configuration flags
- Implement demo reset functionality for clean presentations
- Create demo user accounts with appropriate permissions

### Data Population
- Use data generation scripts to create realistic scenarios
- Ensure GDPR/privacy compliance for all mock data
- Include edge cases that demonstrate system robustness
- Create data that showcases integration with existing systems

### Presentation Interface
- Clean, professional chat interface optimized for demos
- Dashboard showing real-time AI performance metrics
- Admin panel for demo control and scenario selection
- Screen-friendly layouts for projection and remote viewing

## Effort Estimate
**8 story points** (2-3 days)
- Mock data creation and scenario development: 40%
- Demo environment configuration: 30%
- Test conversation scripting: 20%
- Documentation and demo preparation: 10%

## Dependencies
- Core AI chat functionality (Task 4)
- Data integration layer (Task 5)
- User interface implementation (Task 6)
- Authentication and security (Task 7)

## Definition of Done
- Demo environment fully operational with mock data
- All demo scenarios tested and validated
- Conversation flows documented and rehearsed
- Performance metrics established and acceptable
- Demo can be executed consistently without technical issues
- Stakeholder feedback incorporated and addressed

## Testing Approach
- Validate all demo scenarios work as expected
- Test system performance under demo conditions
- Verify data privacy and security in demo environment
- Confirm demo reset functionality works reliably
- Test presentation setup on various devices and networks

## Risk Considerations
- Demo environment performance under presentation conditions
- Network connectivity issues during live demonstrations
- Mock data realism and stakeholder acceptance
- Technical difficulties during critical demo moments
- Scenario coverage may not match all stakeholder interests
