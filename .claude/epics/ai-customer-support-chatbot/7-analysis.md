# Issue #7 Analysis: Knowledge Base and RAG System

## Overview
Create a comprehensive RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system populated with real Texas property tax law data from comptroller.texas.gov and other authoritative sources. This builds upon the existing basic RAG infrastructure while adding comprehensive Texas property tax knowledge and real-time data acquisition capabilities.

## Current Infrastructure Assessment
- **Existing**: Basic RAG tool in `agents/simplified/property_tax_rag_tool.py`
- **Existing**: Vector store framework in `services/vector_store/`
- **Existing**: Google embeddings integration
- **Missing**: Comprehensive knowledge base with Texas property tax law
- **Missing**: Web scraping and document processing pipeline
- **Missing**: Real-time data updates from authoritative sources

## Parallel Streams

### Stream A: Data Acquisition and Web Scraping Infrastructure
- **Scope**: Build web scraping pipeline for comptroller.texas.gov and other Texas property tax sources
- **Files**:
  - `services/data_acquisition/texas_comptroller_scraper.py`
  - `services/data_acquisition/county_appraisal_scraper.py`
  - `services/data_acquisition/document_processor.py`
  - `services/data_acquisition/pdf_processor.py`
  - `services/data_acquisition/scheduler.py`
  - `config/scraping_config.py`
  - `requirements.txt` (add: beautifulsoup4, selenium, PyPDF2, schedule)
- **Duration**: 8-10 hours
- **Dependencies**: None - can start immediately after Stream A in Issue #2

### Stream B: Enhanced Vector Store and Embeddings
- **Scope**: Expand vector store to handle legal documents, improve search capabilities
- **Files**:
  - `services/vector_store/legal_document_indexer.py`
  - `services/vector_store/property_tax_embeddings.py`
  - `services/vector_store/semantic_search.py`
  - `services/vector_store/citation_tracker.py`
  - `services/persistence/knowledge_base_models.py`
  - `agents/simplified/property_tax_rag_tool.py` (enhance existing)
- **Duration**: 6-8 hours
- **Dependencies**: Requires understanding of existing vector store architecture

### Stream C: Knowledge Base Content Processing
- **Scope**: Process and structure Texas property tax law content, create taxonomies
- **Files**:
  - `services/knowledge_base/content_processor.py`
  - `services/knowledge_base/legal_text_cleaner.py`
  - `services/knowledge_base/taxonomy_builder.py`
  - `services/knowledge_base/quality_validator.py`
  - `config/knowledge_base_schema.py`
  - `data/property_tax_taxonomy.json`
  - `data/legal_categories.json`
- **Duration**: 6-8 hours
- **Dependencies**: Can work in parallel with Stream A for data structure design

### Stream D: Search Optimization and Performance
- **Scope**: Optimize retrieval performance, implement caching, add monitoring
- **Files**:
  - `services/vector_store/search_optimizer.py`
  - `services/caching/knowledge_cache.py`
  - `services/monitoring/rag_performance_monitor.py`
  - `agents/simplified/enhanced_property_tax_search.py`
  - `config/performance_settings.py`
  - `tests/test_rag_performance.py`
- **Duration**: 4-6 hours
- **Dependencies**: Requires Streams A and B to have basic functionality

## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Sources Integration
- **Primary**: comptroller.texas.gov property tax sections
- **Secondary**: County appraisal district websites
- **Legal**: Texas Property Tax Code, constitutional provisions
- **Practical**: Forms, procedures, deadlines, fee schedules

### Document Processing Pipeline
1. **Web Scraping**: Respectful scraping with rate limiting
2. **PDF Processing**: Text extraction and structure preservation
3. **Content Cleaning**: Legal document formatting and normalization
4. **Metadata Extraction**: Authority, dates, jurisdiction, citations
5. **Quality Control**: Accuracy verification and conflict detection

### Vector Database Enhancement
- **Chunking Strategy**: Optimized for legal document structure
- **Embedding Models**: Property tax terminology optimization
- **Indexing**: Topic-based categorization (exemptions, appeals, assessments)
- **Search**: Semantic + keyword hybrid approach

### Performance Requirements
- Sub-200ms response times for common queries
- 95% accuracy for property tax questions
- Real-time updates for time-sensitive information
- Scalable architecture for growing document corpus

## Coordination Points
- **Stream A → Stream C**: Data format coordination for content processing
- **Stream A → Stream B**: Document structure needs for embedding optimization
- **Stream B ↔ Stream C**: Knowledge taxonomy affects vector indexing strategy
- **Stream B → Stream D**: Vector store architecture affects performance optimization
- **All Streams → Integration**: Final integration requires all components working together

## Sequential Dependencies
1. **Foundation Phase**: Stream A establishes data acquisition pipeline
2. **Parallel Development**: Streams B, C can develop concurrently with A
3. **Integration Phase**: Stream D optimizes the integrated system
4. **Testing & Validation**: Comprehensive system testing and legal accuracy verification

## Quality Assurance Requirements
- Legal accuracy verification through expert review
- Source citation and reference tracking
- Version control for document updates
- Conflict detection between sources
- Performance benchmarking against requirements

## Success Metrics
- Knowledge base coverage: 100% of major Texas property tax topics
- Query accuracy: 95% for property tax questions
- Response time: <200ms for common queries
- Data freshness: Monthly updates for law changes
- System reliability: 99.9% uptime for knowledge retrieval
