# PRD: fix-log-issues

## Executive Summary

The current logging system has critical infrastructure issues that impair debugging, monitoring, and production operations. This PRD addresses the immediate need to standardize logging frameworks, fix configuration issues, and establish robust logging practices to support reliable operations and efficient incident response.

## Problem Statement

### What problem are we solving?
Our logging system has multiple critical issues:
1. **Mixed logging frameworks** causing incompatible outputs and confusion
2. **Hardcoded file paths** leading to deployment failures
3. **Race conditions** in log directory creation causing startup failures
4. **No log rotation** risking disk space exhaustion
5. **Inconsistent log formats** making parsing and monitoring difficult

### Why is this important now?
- Production debugging is severely hampered by mixed log formats
- Deployment failures occur due to hardcoded paths
- Application startup failures due to logging configuration race conditions
- Risk of disk space exhaustion from unbounded log growth
- Monitoring and alerting systems cannot parse mixed log formats effectively

## User Stories

### Primary User Personas
1. **Developers** - Need clear, consistent logs for debugging
2. **DevOps Engineers** - Need reliable log aggregation and monitoring
3. **Customer Support** - Need accessible logs to investigate user issues
4. **Site Reliability Engineers** - Need consistent log formats for alerting

### Detailed User Journeys

**Developer Debugging Flow:**
- As a developer investigating a production issue
- I need consistent, structured logs with proper timestamps and context
- So I can quickly identify root causes without parsing multiple formats

**DevOps Monitoring Flow:**
- As a DevOps engineer setting up monitoring
- I need standardized JSON log output that can be parsed by log aggregation tools
- So I can create effective alerts and dashboards

**Production Deployment Flow:**
- As a deployment engineer
- I need the application to start reliably regardless of the deployment environment
- So deployments don't fail due to logging configuration issues

### Pain Points Being Addressed
- Mixed JSON and plain text logs requiring multiple parsers
- Application crashes on startup when log directory cannot be created
- Inability to configure log levels per environment
- No way to prevent log files from consuming all disk space
- Inconsistent logger naming making log filtering difficult

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**FR1: Unified Logging Framework**
- Standardize on single logging framework (structlog) across entire codebase
- Remove conflicting logging.basicConfig() usage
- Implement consistent logger creation pattern

**FR2: Configurable Log Directory**
- Replace hardcoded `logs/app.log` with environment variable
- Implement fallback to system temp directory if primary path unavailable
- Create log directory during application startup event

**FR3: Log Rotation**
- Implement size-based log rotation (max 100MB per file)
- Maintain maximum 10 historical log files
- Compress rotated logs to save disk space

**FR4: Environment-Based Configuration**
- Support configurable log levels via environment variables
- Different log configurations for dev/staging/production
- Support for disabling file logging in containerized environments

**FR5: Structured Logging Standards**
- All logs must use JSON format for machine parsing
- Mandatory fields: timestamp, level, component, event, message
- Optional contextual fields: user_id, request_id, correlation_id

### Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1: Performance**
- Logging operations must not add more than 5ms overhead to request processing
- Asynchronous logging for high-frequency operations
- Buffer management to prevent memory leaks

**NFR2: Reliability**
- Application must start successfully even if logging fails
- Graceful degradation when log directory is unavailable
- No application crashes due to logging errors

**NFR3: Compliance**
- Support for log redaction of sensitive information (PII, credentials)
- Configurable log retention policies
- Audit trail capabilities for compliance requirements

**NFR4: Monitoring Integration**
- Compatible with ELK stack, Fluentd, and other log aggregation tools
- Support for distributed tracing correlation IDs
- Metrics integration for log volume and error rates

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes
1. **Zero deployment failures** due to logging configuration (current: ~20% failure rate)
2. **100% consistent log format** across all components (current: mixed formats)
3. **Sub-5ms logging overhead** measured via performance benchmarks
4. **Zero application crashes** due to logging errors
5. **Reduced debug time** by 50% due to structured logs

### Key Metrics and KPIs
- Deployment success rate: Target 100% (current ~80%)
- Log parsing errors: Target 0% (current ~30% due to mixed formats)
- Disk space usage: Controlled growth vs unbounded (current issue)
- Debug session duration: Reduce by 50%
- Log-related support tickets: Reduce by 80%

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Limitations
- Must maintain backward compatibility during transition period
- Cannot change existing log aggregation infrastructure immediately
- Must work within current Python/FastAPI technology stack

### Timeline Constraints
- Critical fixes (startup failures) must be resolved within 1 week
- Full implementation should complete within 3 weeks
- Cannot disrupt current production logging during transition

### Resource Limitations
- Single developer assigned to logging infrastructure
- No additional infrastructure budget for new log management tools
- Must leverage existing monitoring and alerting systems

## Out of Scope

### Explicitly NOT Building
- New log aggregation infrastructure (use existing)
- Real-time log streaming capabilities
- Log analytics dashboard (separate project)
- Integration with external log management services (Splunk, etc.)
- Historical log format conversion (only new logs use new format)
- Custom log visualization tools

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- structlog library (already in requirements)
- Python logging module compatibility
- File system permissions in deployment environments

### Internal Team Dependencies
- DevOps team for deployment environment configuration
- QA team for testing across different environments
- Infrastructure team for disk space monitoring setup

### Service Dependencies
- Application must start independently of logging configuration
- Database services should not be affected by logging changes
- API endpoints must maintain current response times

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Week 1)
1. Fix hardcoded log directory path
2. Resolve startup race condition
3. Implement basic log rotation

### Phase 2: Standardization (Week 2)
1. Standardize on structlog framework
2. Implement consistent logger creation
3. Add environment-based configuration

### Phase 3: Enhancement (Week 3)
1. Add structured logging standards
2. Implement performance optimizations
3. Add monitoring integration hooks
