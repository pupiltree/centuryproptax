# PRD: Remove Redundant Krishna Diagnostics Code Files

## Executive Summary

**Project Name**: Remove Redundant Krishna Diagnostics Code Files
**Product Owner**: Development Team
**Priority**: High
**Timeline**: 1-2 days
**Status**: Completed

### Problem Statement
After successfully transforming the Krishna Diagnostics medical codebase into Century Property Tax system, several redundant medical-specific files remain that are no longer used. These files create technical debt, confusion, and potential security vulnerabilities while consuming unnecessary storage and maintenance overhead.

### Solution Overview
Conduct comprehensive codebase analysis to identify and remove all Krishna Diagnostics/medical-related files that are not actively used by the Century Property Tax system, while ensuring no breaking changes to the current functionality.

### Success Metrics
- **Code Reduction**: Remove 1,000+ lines of unused medical code
- **File Count**: Eliminate 4+ redundant medical files
- **Import Health**: Zero broken imports after cleanup
- **Functionality**: 100% preservation of current property tax features
- **Security**: Remove potential medical data exposure vectors

## Business Context

### Current State Analysis
The Century Property Tax system was successfully adapted from Krishna Diagnostics medical platform, preserving the core LangGraph architecture while transforming the domain logic. However, several medical-specific files remained that serve no purpose in the property tax context:

1. **Medical Test Scripts**: Glucose test addition utilities
2. **Medical Voice Agents**: Krishna-specific voice integration
3. **Medical Vector Store**: Test indexing for medical data
4. **Medical Import Chains**: Broken references to medical repositories

### Business Impact
- **Technical Debt**: Unused code increases maintenance burden
- **Security Risk**: Medical data handling code could create HIPAA compliance issues
- **Developer Confusion**: Medical terminology and logic confuses property tax developers
- **Storage Waste**: Unused files consume repository space and CI/CD time
- **Compliance Risk**: Mixed medical/tax code could complicate TDLR audits
