# PRD: Remove Redundant Files

## Executive Summary

Century Property Tax codebase contains extensive unused components inherited from the Krishna Diagnostics clone. Despite successful domain transformation, the repository retains entire service directories, tools, and dependencies that serve no purpose for the property tax chatbot requirements. This PRD establishes a systematic approach to identify, validate, and remove redundant files while preserving the essential LangGraph architecture and required functionality defined in the AI Customer Support Chatbot PRD.

**Impact**: Reduce repository size by 40-60%, improve developer onboarding, eliminate security risks from unused code, and create a focused codebase aligned with actual business requirements.

## Problem Statement

### Core Problem
The Century Property Tax codebase is bloated with unused Krishna Diagnostics components that create maintenance overhead, security risks, and developer confusion. The complete cloning approach brought medical domain services that have no relevance to property tax operations.

### Specific Issues Identified
1. **Voice Processing Services** (`/services/voice/`) - PRD explicitly excludes voice/audio processing
2. **Image Analysis Services** (`/services/image_analysis/`) - No computer vision requirements for property tax
3. **Instagram Integration** - PRD focuses "WhatsApp only", Instagram components unused
4. **Medical Domain Tools** - Remnant medical tools and configurations not applicable
5. **Advanced Analytics** - Complex dashboards marked as "future consideration" in PRD
6. **Redundant Dependencies** - Package dependencies for unused services
7. **Orphaned Test Files** - Medical domain tests with no equivalent property tax coverage

### Business Impact
- **Developer Confusion**: 60%+ of codebase irrelevant to property tax domain
- **Security Risk**: Unused code paths create potential vulnerabilities
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Updates and patches applied to unused components
- **Repository Bloat**: Slower clones, larger deployments, increased storage costs
- **Onboarding Friction**: New developers must navigate irrelevant medical code

## Conclusion

The removal of redundant Krishna Diagnostics files represents a critical step in establishing Century Property Tax as a focused, maintainable, and secure property tax chatbot system. By systematically eliminating unused voice processing, image analysis, Instagram integration, and medical domain components, we create a clean foundation that aligns codebase reality with business requirements.

This cleanup effort directly supports the AI Customer Support Chatbot success criteria by removing distractions, reducing security risks, and improving developer productivity. The aggressive but methodical approach ensures we preserve the proven LangGraph architecture while eliminating everything that doesn't serve property tax protest conversion objectives.

**Expected Outcome**: A lean, focused Century Property Tax codebase containing only components necessary for WhatsApp-based property tax consulting, enabling faster development, simpler maintenance, and cleaner compliance audits.
