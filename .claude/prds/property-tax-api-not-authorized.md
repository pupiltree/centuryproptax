# PRD: property-tax-api-not-authorized

## Executive Summary

The current application attempts to integrate with Texas Comptroller government APIs for property tax data, but these credentials are not authorized for actual use. This PRD outlines the implementation of a comprehensive mock data system that will replace the unauthorized government API calls with realistic, demo-ready data that maintains all functionality while enabling effective product demonstrations and development workflows.

## Problem Statement

### What problem are we solving?
The application currently references unauthorized Texas Comptroller API endpoints:
- `PROPERTY_TAX_CALCULATOR_API=https://api.comptroller.texas.gov/property/calculator`
- `PROPERTY_RECORDS_API=https://api.comptroller.texas.gov/property/records`
- `PROPERTY_TAX_NOTIFICATIONS_API=https://api.comptroller.texas.gov/notifications`
- `PROPERTY_TAX_PAYMENTS_API=https://api.comptroller.texas.gov/payments`

These endpoints either:
1. Require proper government authorization we don't have
2. May not exist in the current form
3. Cannot be used for demo/development purposes
4. Block the application from functioning properly

### Why is this important now?
- **Demo Readiness**: Product demonstrations fail due to API authorization errors
- **Development Workflow**: Developers cannot test property tax features effectively
- **User Experience**: Features appear broken to stakeholders and potential customers
- **Business Impact**: Cannot showcase core value proposition of property tax assistance
- **Compliance**: Using unauthorized government APIs may raise legal/ethical concerns
