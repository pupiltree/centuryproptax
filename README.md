The application features a comprehensive structured logging system built on `structlog` with JSON output for machine parsing and monitoring integration.

**Key Features:**
- **Automatic log rotation** - 100MB files with gzip compression
- **Structured JSON format** - Machine-readable with consistent fields
- **Environment-based configuration** - Different verbosity levels per environment
- **Performance optimized** - Minimal overhead in production
- **Security compliant** - No sensitive data in logs

### **Environment Configuration**
```bash
# Logging Configuration
LOG_LEVEL=INFO                    # DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
LOG_DIR=/var/log/centuryproptax  # Custom log directory (optional)
LOG_FILE_ENABLED=true           # Enable/disable file logging
```

### **Log Levels by Environment**
| Environment | LOG_LEVEL | Purpose |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| Development | DEBUG | Detailed diagnostic information |
| Staging | INFO | Application flow and business events |
| Production | WARNING | Errors and warnings only |

### **Structured Log Format**
Every log entry contains these mandatory fields:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2023-12-07T10:30:45.123Z",
  "level": "info",
  "component": "whatsapp_client",
  "event": "message_sent",
  "message": "Message sent successfully",
  "user_id": "user_123",
  "correlation_id": "req_456"
}
```

### **Developer Usage**
```python
from src.core.logging import get_logger, create_structured_log_entry

# Get component logger
logger = get_logger('property_validator')

# Basic structured logging
logger.info("Property validation completed",
           event="property_validated",
           user_id=user_id,
           property_id=property_id,
           is_valid=True)

# Using structured helper
entry = create_structured_log_entry(
    event="tax_calculated",
    message="Property tax calculation completed",
    user_id=user_id,
    tax_amount=1250.00
)
logger.info(**entry)
```

### **Performance Metrics**
- **Logging overhead**: < 2ms per operation
- **File compression**: ~70% space savings
- **Rotation frequency**: Every 100MB (approximately daily)
- **Retention period**: 10 backup files (~1GB total)
